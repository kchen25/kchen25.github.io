                <p>I'm a first-year at Harvard who loves thinking about CS, graphic design, and how they fit together. 
                    I've conducted UI/UX research with Harvard Student Agencies, designed the website and marketing content 
                    for the largest student-run conference for women engineers, and am part of the web team for Datamatch, 
                    a satirical college matchmaking service with over 40,000 users.
